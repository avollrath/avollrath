            I'm currently immersed in the world of web development, exploring the capabilities of <strong>Astro.js</strong> and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> to craft efficient and responsive web applications. Both of these technologies offer a unique approach to building websites, and I'm enjoying the learning process.

            On the literary front, I'm delving into <strong>"The Count of Monte Cristo" by Alexandre Dumas</strong>, a classic tale of adventure and intrigue, alongside <strong>"How to Win at Chess" by Levy Rozman</strong>, which is sharpening my strategic thinking on the chessboard.

            In the realm of music, I've been practicing <strong>"Comptine d'un autre été" by Yann Tiersen</strong> on the piano, a piece that's both challenging and deeply rewarding.
